    "The ninja closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before slowly exhaling and opening his eyes. He looked towards the guard, who was about fifty feet away and positioned behind a large tree. The ninja took another deep breath and tried to focus on the guard, but his mind was foggy. He took another deep breath and tried to clear his mind, but it was no use. The guard saw the ninja and started to walk towards him, and the ninja knew that he was doomed. He lost his balance as he caught his foot in the tree's roots. The guard captured him and took him to a holding cell.",
    "The ninja tried to take out the guard from a distance, but his arrows never quite reached the target. In frustration, the ninja ran towards the guard, hoping to get close enough to slice him with his katana. But before he could even get close, the guard raised his sword and sliced the ninja's abdomen open.",
    "As the ninja approached the guard, he carefully weighed his options. He could throw the explosive tag at the guard, but this would likely result in his capture. Alternatively, he could try to sneak up on the guard and stab him in the back, but this too was risky. In the end, the ninja decided on the less risky option and threw the explosive tag instead. Unfortunately, the guard was already aware of his presence and was able to apprehend the ninja before he could cause any damage.",
    "The ninja, eager to prove himself to his master, tried his hardest to throw the explosive tag at the guard, but his aim was off. The guard easily caught the tag and, before the ninja could react, threw it back at him, injuring him in the process. The ninja was quickly apprehended"
